# The-Daily-Astrology-Brief
The Daily Astrology Brief as heard in "The Life of a Young, Struggling Schizophrenic" Podcast. A readable storage of the daily brief.

With this segment, also known as chapter, of my podcast I use the data pulled from mobile applications and present it each morning at 05:00 in an episode of the podcast "The Life of a Young, Struggling Schizophrenic".

The published episodes are sometimes consisting of only the Daily Astrology Brief chapter, while others have more chapters and run a little longer.

For each published podcast episode containing a chapter "The Daily Astrology Brief" I will be uploading a corresponding file, if not before the episode airs even.
