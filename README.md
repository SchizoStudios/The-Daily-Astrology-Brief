The Life of a Young, Struggling Schizophrenic

That's the name of my podcast. Well, if I am completely honest about it it's a whole lot more than just a podcast.

A little bit ab9out me...
I really crave, might actually be on the border of obsess over, the oppurtunity to gather and collect knowledge.
Often times I don't have the memory strenght to memorize every little aspect of a study that I am pursuing, say astrology for example.
I have a really hard time remembering all the aspects and planetary symbolizations and meanings and so forth, so I plan to share my pursuit of knowledge with my podcast listeners.
I have had quite a few...well to say the least quite a few story-worthy adventures... They might have been spiritual exsperiences, they could be due to my schizophrenia diagnosis, and who is to say that just because it is one, it isn't the other at the same time? Perhaps my Spirituality is conjunct with my Schizophrenia... (to throw an astrologyh application into the mix ;)

I would love to share the whole adventure I travel while pursuing the desired end result, and by golly, also gosh darnit, also da gummit, I will reach that desired result and this repository will help me get there, and then beyond!!!

Chapters/Segments are the different audio chapters of my podcast. They so far consist of "The Daily Astrology Brief", "Episode Commentary" and "Story-Time".

My quest to standardize a comprehensive and conclusive (not quite so to be a finality of, but a complete and consice compilation) documentation of the building blocks of Astrologu, the Arithmetic of Astrology - also known  as "Astrology Arith(m)etic.

I might keep my Astrology Arithetic private until I am further along in its creation/compilation. I Suppose we will see

This Repository is meant to help be a way for me to bring my scattered thoughts into a presaentable way to the general public.

With that I have one thing to say to end this ReadMe, or maybe a few (...), as one door closes, we leap into a-whole-nother oppurtunity - XIII not goodbye, but Salutations to another sunrise.
